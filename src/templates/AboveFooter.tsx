We need to maintain what we build. Even when requirements donâ€™t change (highly unlikely ðŸ˜Š), the world and technology changes. Most of the time, developers are reading code. We spend a lot of time onboarding new people to our codebase. That does not have to be an unpleasant experience if we have a good code to work with."
